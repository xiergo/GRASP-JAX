We have successfully reproduced the results for several cases in our paper, including 1DE4 and 4G3Y. 
Due to the large size of the features.pkl file and the results files, 
we have uploaded the relevant data to the following link: 
https://osf.io/6kjuq/files/osfstorage, under the folder "Datasets/reproduced_results_of_some_cases".
